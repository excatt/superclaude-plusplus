# Algorithmic Art

This skill enables creation of **generative art using p5.js** with seeded randomness and interactive parameter exploration.

## Trigger
- When user requests generative or algorithmic art
- Creating interactive visualizations with p5.js
- Building parametric design systems
- Developing art with mathematical foundations

## Three-Step Process

1. **Algorithmic Philosophy** - Develop computational aesthetic manifesto
   - 4-6 paragraphs emphasizing emergent behavior
   - Mathematical beauty and controlled chaos
   - Craftsmanship focus

2. **Conceptual Deduction** - Identify thematic DNA
   - Sophisticated references in parameters
   - Behavioral design choices
   - Visual identity

3. **p5.js Implementation** - Single HTML artifact
   - Self-contained with inline code
   - Seeded randomness for reproducibility
   - Parametric tuning and interactive controls

## Implementation Standards

**Setup:**
- Start from `templates/viewer.html` as foundation
- Keep Anthropic branding fixed
- Replace only variable sections

**Requirements:**
- Balance complexity with visual clarity
- Thoughtful color harmony
- Maintain visual hierarchy in randomness
- Optimize performance
- Ensure reproducibility (same seed = identical output)

## Deliverable

Single self-contained HTML artifact with:
- All JavaScript inline
- p5.js loaded from CDN
- Interactive parameter controls
- Seeded randomness system
- Responsive design

## Use When

- Creating generative visual art
- Building interactive algorithmic visualizations
- Developing parametric design systems
- Exploring computational aesthetics
- Building interactive mathematical visualizations
